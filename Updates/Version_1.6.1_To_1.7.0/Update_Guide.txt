Update Server Side:
=========================
  1. First of all, Make a Full Backup. We cannot stress enough how important it is to *always* take a full backup
      before attempting any kind of update. Both for Server Side and Android Side. A full backup should be taken
      of both the codes and the database.
  2. Upload the "Effected File(s)" to your existing installation folder replacing any existing folders & files. (Notice: Be careful with your custom changes).
  3. Done.

=========================

=========================
  1. Copy "Effected File(s)" to your existing project. (Notice: Be careful with your package name and custom changes).
