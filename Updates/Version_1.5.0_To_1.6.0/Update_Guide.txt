Update Server Side:
=========================
  1. First of all, Make a Full Backup. We cannot stress enough how important it is to *always* take a full backup
      before attempting any kind of update. Both for Server Side and Android Side. A full backup should be taken
      of both the codes and the database.
  2. Upload the "Effected File(s)" to your existing installation folder replacing any existing folders & files. (Notice: Be careful with your custom changes).
  3. Import "UPDATE_SQL.sql" into your database via PhpMyAdmin.
  4. Done.

=========================
Update Android Side:
=========================
  1. Upgrade your Android Studio to 3.5 or newer.
  2. Copy "Effected File(s)" to your existing project. (Notice: Be careful with your package name and custom changes).
  3. Done.
